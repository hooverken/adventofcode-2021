Day 3's puzzles involve decoding input by parsing bit vaolues from strings that are in the form of twelve-character binary strings like "011010010001".  

The first part I was able to knock out pretty quickly (but not very elegantly) but the second part sent me back to the drawing board algorithm-wise but I finally got it working late on day 3. 

Unlike prior days, a single script does both computations, though they could be separated without too much trouble.
