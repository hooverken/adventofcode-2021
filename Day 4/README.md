Day 4 puzzles are based on a form of bingo, where you map numbers onto 5x5 boards of digits to see which board generates a bing (verttically or horizontally).

I had some trouble with this because I had to use a couple of new (to me) Powershell features - classes and arraylists.  But I got it done!
